      <h2 class="title">TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
        you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
        using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
        of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
        to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
        translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
        app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
        other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
        VidMate Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        VidMate Studio is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
        changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
        any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
        making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The VidMate app stores and processes personal data that you have
        provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your
        responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
        therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which
        is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
        by the official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
        phone’s security features and it could mean that the VidMate app won’t
        work properly or at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that VidMate Studio
        will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
        require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
        can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but VidMate
        Studio cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
        of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
        you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
        data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
        that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
        using the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, VidMate Studio cannot always take responsibility
        for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
        stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
        avail the Service, VidMate Studio cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to VidMate Studio’s responsibility for your use of the app,
        when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although
        we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we
        do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can
        make it available to you. VidMate Studio accepts no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly
        on this functionality of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
        available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any
        additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
        may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
        using the app. VidMate Studio does not promise that it will always
        update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
        Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you
        promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you,
        we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
        at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell
        you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
        to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
        needed) delete it from your device. Changes to This Terms and Conditions

      <p>
        We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are
        advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify
        you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
